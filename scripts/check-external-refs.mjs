/**
 * Fails when a tracked file describes something that lives *outside* this
 * repository: a system this one supposedly succeeds, "the old" way of doing
 * a thing, what is true "today", a setup the reader is assumed to already
 * know — or a fact about somebody's real machine, browsing or infrastructure.
 * Everything here has to read as an application built from scratch, because
 * that is the only thing a reader of a public repository can verify.
 *
 * This is a check rather than a line in a style guide because the failure
 * mode is forgetting, not disagreeing. Prose drifts back toward whatever the
 * author had in their head; a gate in CI is the only version of the rule
 * that survives the tenth pull request.
 *
 * ── How it matches: SHAPES, NEVER VALUES ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Almost every pattern below is a *grammatical or syntactic shape* — "the
 * old …", "port of …", "replaces …", a drive letter followed by a
 * backslash, four dotted octets in a private range. None of them is, or may
 * become, a list of the real names, hosts, usernames, retailers or project
 * names that must stay out of this repository. Writing those in "so they
 * can be grepped for" publishes precisely what the rule exists to keep out,
 * and a denylist wearing a regular expression as a costume is the same
 * mistake with extra steps. If you find yourself adding one of *those*
 * proper nouns here, stop: the answer is a shape, or nothing.
 *
 * There is exactly one construction that legitimately writes proper nouns
 * into a check like this, and it is the opposite one: an **allowlist** of
 * the names this repository is *permitted* to say. `ALLOWED_HOSTS` below is
 * that construction, and it is the only place in this file where a real
 * name appears. It names nothing private — every entry is a public
 * documentation host or a reserved example domain — so it does not breach
 * the rule above. What it costs is a list somebody has to extend the day a
 * new citation lands, and the failure mode of that cost is noise on a
 * legitimate addition. It is judged worth paying **here specifically**,
 * because this is a browser-automation codebase: example URLs accrete by
 * the nature of the work, every one of them is a fact about where somebody
 * really goes, and no grammatical shape can tell a retailer from a
 * standards body.
 *
 * ── What this does NOT check, and what a green run therefore means ──────
 *
 * **A green run means the recurring phrasings are absent. It does not mean
 * the prose is clean.** Those are different claims and only the first is
 * tested here. Specifically:
 *
 *   - **No shape matches a private proper noun in ordinary prose.** A name
 *     dropped into a sentence — a machine, a service, a project, a shop —
 *     passes every pattern below unless it happens to appear inside a URL,
 *     and that is the single most likely thing to leak.
 *   - **No shape matches a sentence that is merely unverifiable**: prose
 *     that reads fine but only makes sense to someone who has seen a system
 *     this repository does not contain.
 *   - **The vocabulary lists are finite, on both sides of every shape.**
 *     `old <noun>` matches a fixed set of nouns, and an unlisted one goes
 *     through — but so does an unlisted *inflection* of a verb that is
 *     otherwise covered. Treat every alternation below as a list somebody
 *     wrote once, not as a category.
 *   - **`ALLOWED_HOSTS` only governs hosts inside a URL.** A bare hostname
 *     written in a sentence, with no scheme in front of it, is invisible to
 *     the host shape.
 *
 * So: this is a backstop, not a proof. **Reading the diff is not something
 * a green tick discharges** — it is the mechanism that catches everything
 * in the list above, and this check exists to stop the recurring phrasings
 * consuming the attention that reading needs.
 *
 * ── Recording a deliberate exception ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Some of these shapes have honest in-repo uses. Waive them one line at a
 * time, with a reason, in a comment the language already supports:
 *
 *     <!-- external-ref-ok: <why this one is about this repo> -->
 *     // external-ref-ok-next-line: <why this one is about this repo>
 *
 * A waiver's own line is never scanned — its reason is prose about the rule,
 * not content the rule applies to. So `external-ref-ok` covers the line it
 * sits on, and `external-ref-ok-next-line` covers **that line and the one
 * after it**. Be precise about which line you attach it to: a waiver covers
 * the *whole* line, so on a long hard-wrapped one it can silence more than
 * you meant. The run summary prints how many matches the waivers in a tree
 * are silencing, so that creep is visible rather than quiet.
 *
 * The reason is mandatory and has to read as a phrase — several real words,
 * not twelve characters of padding. A waiver that says nothing fails the
 * check itself, so silencing it always costs an explanation sitting in the
 * diff beside the text it excuses.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-external-refs.mjs            # every tracked file
 *   node scripts/check-external-refs.mjs a.md b.md  # just these

 * summary prints these counts, so waiver creep shows up in the CI log
 * instead of only in a careful reading of the diff.
